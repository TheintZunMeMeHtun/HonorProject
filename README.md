# Eco Wardrobe - Sustainable Fashion App

Eco Wardrobe is a user-friendly app designed to promote sustainable fashion choices. Developed under the mentorship of Dr. Azhar for the CSC2211 Honor Project at BMCC, this app features clothing items made from recycled materials sourced from BMCC college recycles.

## Sustainability Focus

The fashion industry significantly impacts the environment. To combat this, Eco Wardrobe curates a diverse selection of sustainable clothing options, encouraging conscious consumption and showcasing the potential of recycled materials.
## Project Description
 This project aims to address the limited availability of sustainable fashion options by developing a user-friendly app named "Eco Wardrobe." This app will curate a diverse selection of clothing items made from BMCC college recycles and other sustainable materials. Users can easily browse, shop, and contribute to a greener fashion industry, promoting conscious consumption.
Integration of BMCC Recycles: The heart of our project lies in the integration of recycled materials sourced from BMCC into our fashion app. By collaborating with BMCC, we can create a unique selling point for Eco Wardrobe, showcasing the beauty and sustainability of garments crafted from materials recycled within the local community.
Educational and Awareness Features: In addition to being a marketplace, Eco Wardrobe will include educational features highlighting the environmental benefits of recycled materials and BMCC's recycling initiatives. This will not only inform users about sustainable practices but also increase the visibility of BMCC's commitment to environmental sustainability.
